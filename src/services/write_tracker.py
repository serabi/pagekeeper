"""
Write-suppression tracker — prevents self-triggered feedback loops.

Call record_write(client_name, book_id) after Stitch successfully pushes
progress to any client. Call is_own_write(client_name, book_id) before acting
on a progress change from that client to suppress round-trip echoes.

Supported client_name values: 'ABS', 'Storyteller', 'BookLore', 'KoSync'
