# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

All notable changes to PageKeeper will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- **Diagnostic test buttons** — Each service section on the Settings page now has a "Test" button that verifies connectivity and authentication in one click. Covers Audiobookshelf, Storyteller, Booklore, CWA, Hardcover, and Telegram. Returns human-readable error messages (e.g., "Authentication failed — check your username and password") instead of raw HTTP status codes.
- **Storyteller native alignment** — Alignment maps can now be built directly from Storyteller's word-level timing data (`wordTimeline`), bypassing Whisper transcription entirely. Mount Storyteller's processing directory and set the Assets Directory in Settings. New alignment priority chain: Storyteller native → SMIL → Whisper.
- **Socket-driven suggestion discovery** — When an unmapped audiobook is detected via ABS Socket.IO events, PageKeeper automatically queues a suggestion search in the background. Thread-safe with lock + in-flight set to prevent duplicate work.
- **Reverse suggestions** — Books with reading progress in Storyteller or Booklore now trigger searches for matching audiobooks in Audiobookshelf, surfacing pairing candidates in both directions.
- **Storyteller as suggestion source** — Storyteller is now searched alongside Booklore and CWA when discovering ebook matches for audiobook suggestions.
- **Pairing suggestions page** — Dedicated `/suggestions` page with card grid, cover images, match candidates with source labels, filter/search, and Dismiss/Link/Never Ask actions.
- **Suggestions nav link** — Added "Suggestions" to the navigation bar.
- **Processing books dashboard UX** — Dedicated "Processing" section on the dashboard with status-specific card rendering: striped progress bars for active jobs, pulsing dot for queued books, retry count for failed jobs. CSS status accents (cyan/amber/red left borders), contextual footer text, and sanitized menu actions for pending/processing/failed states. Live polling via `/api/processing-status` refreshes every 5 seconds and reloads the page on status transitions.
- **Reading date sync from external sources** — `started_at` and `finished_at` dates are now pulled from Hardcover (`user_book_reads`) and Audiobookshelf (`mediaProgress.startedAt`/`finishedAt`) instead of defaulting to today's date. A one-time backfill runs on dashboard load for books missing dates. Books found to be finished externally are automatically marked as completed.
- **Sync Reading Dates button** — New "Sync Reading Dates" tool in Settings → Tools tab. Triggers an on-demand pull of reading dates from Hardcover and ABS for all books missing them, with a summary of updated/completed/error counts.
- **Auto-complete at 100% progress** — Active books reaching ≥ 99% sync progress are automatically marked as completed and push 100% to all services. Includes re-read guard: skips auto-complete if local progress is 1–95% with an external `finished_at` date set.
- **Sync read status to Booklore** — Mark Complete pushes `READ` status to Booklore (auto-sets `dateFinished`). Resume pushes `READING` status. Supports dual Booklore instances.
- **Sync status to all services (completed books)** — Completed books now have a "Sync status to all services" menu action that pushes 100% completion to all configured services and reloads the page.

### Changed

- **Suggestions Link button** — Clicking "Link" on a suggestion now pre-fills the match page with the book's title and pre-selects the audiobook, instead of opening an empty match page.
- **Suggestions empty state** — Shows context-aware messages: explains that no candidates have been found yet when suggestions are enabled, or prompts the user to enable them in Settings (with a direct link) when disabled.
- **Completed book menu cleanup** — Completed books now show only "Sync status to all services" and "Clear Progress" in the kebab menu. Removed redundant "Mark Complete" and "Sync Now" actions.

### Fixed

- **Hardcover test button** — Hardcover's GraphQL API returns `me` as a list; the test now handles both list and dict response shapes.
- **KOSync stale shadow documents** — Sibling document resolution now skips documents not updated in the last 30 days, preventing stale shadow entries from overriding current progress.
- **Alignment map validation** — Loading alignment maps from the database now validates each point for required `char` (int) and `ts` (float) keys, skipping malformed entries with a warning instead of crashing.
- **Completed books missing from Finished section** — Books with `status == 'completed'` now appear in the Finished section regardless of their `unified_progress` value.
- **Clear progress re-sync bounce** — After clearing progress, 0% state records are now saved to the database. Previously states were only deleted, causing the next sync cycle to re-sync stale external progress back.
- **Clear progress blocking UI** — Clear progress now runs in a background thread to avoid blocking the UI for ~37 seconds waiting on the sync lock.
- **Booklore UNIQUE constraint with multiple sources** — Migration force-recreates `booklore_books` table with composite `(filename, source)` unique constraint, replacing the stale single-column constraint that failed when the same filename existed across multiple Booklore instances.
- **Sync Now silent failure for completed books** — Fixed broken import in `reading_date_service.py` and routed completed books to push 100% completion directly instead of going through `sync_cycle` (which skips non-active books).

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Reading tracker data model** — New `started_at`, `finished_at`, `rating`, and `read_count` fields on books; `ReadingJournal` and `ReadingGoal` tables for tracking reading history and yearly goals.

### Fixed

- **Idempotent mark-complete** — Repeated calls to `/api/mark-complete` on an already-completed book no longer inflate `read_count`. The increment is now guarded by a status check.
- **Input validation for reading fields** — `rating` (0–5), `read_count` (≥ 1), and `target_books` (≥ 0) are now validated before persistence, preventing invalid data from reaching the database.

---

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **Dashboard status filter** — Filter the book grid by status (Currently Reading, Finished, Paused, DNF) or sync mode (Audiobook, Ebook-only) via the "Show:" dropdown. Sections with no matching cards are automatically hidden.

---

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-02

### Security

- **Path traversal fix (CWE-22)** — Sanitize `ebook_filename` at all HTTP input boundaries and validate resolved paths before file deletion/access. Prevents arbitrary file deletion via crafted filenames flowing through database lookups into `Path().unlink()`.
- **Pin h11>=0.16.0** — Fix critical HTTP Request Smuggling vulnerability (CVE-2025-43859, CVSS 9.3) in transitive dependency via `python-socketio`.
- **Upgrade Docker base image to python:3.13-slim** — Resolves `util-linux` (CVE-2026-3184) and `zlib` low-severity vulnerabilities in the previous Debian base.

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-02

### Changed

- **Hot-reload settings without server restart** — Saving settings now applies changes in-process instead of restarting the container. Handles LOG_LEVEL reconfiguration, SYNC_PERIOD_MINS rescheduling, and ABS Socket.IO listener start/stop/restart.
- **KoSync password Show/Hide toggle** — The KoSync password field now has a Show/Hide button that fetches the saved value on demand, so you can see the password you need to retype in KOReader without exposing it in the page source.
- **Save Settings button right-aligned** — The floating Save bar now aligns the button to the right.

### Fixed

- **Settings tab resets to General on save** — The active tab is now preserved across saves via a hidden form field.
- **Navbar icons persisting for disabled services** — Service icons are now gated on their `*_ENABLED` flags.

### Removed

- **Shelfmark integration** — Removed the Shelfmark iframe view, navbar icon, settings UI, and all associated configuration (`SHELFMARK_URL`, `SHELFMARK_ENABLED`).

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **Security: API token no longer sent as URL query parameter** — The cover proxy now passes the ABS token via `Authorization: Bearer` header instead of `?token=` in the URL, preventing it from leaking into logs, browser history, and referrer headers.
- **Security: Secrets removed from settings HTML** — Password and API token fields no longer emit their stored value into the DOM. Fields show an `(unchanged)` placeholder when a value is set, and the backend preserves existing secrets when the field is submitted empty.
- **Docker test entrypoint** — Fixed `sh -c` argument handling in `docker-compose.test.yml` that leaked the shell name (`sh`) as a stray pytest argument when passing flags via `run-tests.sh`.
- **Sync engine: `client_pct` null safety** — `client_pct` is now sanitized after reading from client state, preventing `TypeError` when the value is explicitly `None` (e.g., from a JSON `null`).
- **Navbar icon flash on page reload** — Added intrinsic `width`/`height` attributes to the app icon to prevent it from rendering at full native size before CSS loads.
- **Test assertion** — Removed stale emoji prefix from sync unit test assertion to match current log format.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-01

### Initial Release

PageKeeper is a self-hosted sync engine that links audiobook listening positions to matching spots in ebooks. It transcribes a segment of the audiobook audio, fuzzy-matches it against the EPUB text, and builds an alignment map. Once built, converting between a timestamp and a page position is instant.

Forked from [abs-kosync-bridge](https://github.com/JadeTech-Solutions/abs-kosync-bridge) and rebuilt with a new architecture, simplified feature set, and fresh identity.

### Supported Platforms

| Platform | Type | Function |
|----------|------|----------|
| [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/) | Audiobook server | Main audiobook source; reads/writes progress in seconds |
| [KOReader](https://koreader.rocks/) (via KoSync) | E-reader protocol | Ebook reader on Kobo, Boox, Kindle; syncs EPUB position via XPath |
| [Storyteller](https://smoores.gitlab.io/storyteller/) | Audiobook companion | Synced audiobook + EPUB app; REST API v2 |
| [Booklore](https://github.com/booklore) | Ebook library | Ebook manager; provides EPUB files and tracks reading progress |
| [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/) | Book tracking | Write-only; logs reading progress for stats and tracking |
| [Calibre-Web (CWA)](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web) | OPDS ebook source | Alternative source for fetching EPUBs via OPDS |

All integrations are optional. Use as few or as many as you want.

### Core Features

- **Multi-platform sync** — Keeps audiobook and ebook positions in sync across all configured platforms. Progress changes on one platform are automatically converted and pushed to every other connected client.
- **Three-tier sync engine:**
  - **Instant sync** — Listens to ABS Socket.IO playback events and KoSync PUT updates in real time. Syncs within ~30 seconds of a user action.
  - **Per-client polling** — Lightweight independent polling for Storyteller and Booklore at configurable intervals. Only triggers sync when position actually changes.
  - **Scheduled full sync** — Background sweep every N minutes that catches anything the other layers missed.
- **Audio-to-text alignment** — Transcribes audiobook segments using Whisper (local CPU/GPU), Deepgram (cloud), or Whisper.cpp (external server). Fuzzy-matches against EPUB text via N-gram anchoring. Alignment map is cached in the database — subsequent syncs are instant.
- **Universal book import** — Import books as audio-only, ebook-only, or linked (audio + ebook). Not every book needs both formats.
- **Web dashboard** — Book grid with cover art, per-service progress, out-of-sync warnings, search/filter, and quick actions (sync now, mark complete, edit mapping, delete).
- **Settings UI** — All configuration managed from the web interface. Multi-library ABS picker, per-service toggles, sync tuning. Settings persist in the database; environment variables are only needed for initial bootstrapping.
- **Split-port security** — Run the KoSync API on a separate port from the admin dashboard. Expose the sync endpoint to the internet while keeping the dashboard on your LAN.
- **Write suppression** — Centralized write tracker prevents feedback loops across all clients. If PageKeeper just pushed a position to a service, the echo that comes back is silently dropped.
- **Auto-suggestions** — Discovers unmapped books with activity and fuzzy-matches them to potential ebook counterparts for user approval.
- **Batch matching** — Link multiple books at once from a queue interface.
- **Telegram notifications** — Forward log events to a Telegram chat at a configurable severity threshold.
- **Thread-safe EPUB caching** — LRU cache with locking for concurrent access from the sync daemon, background jobs, and web requests.
- **Alembic migrations** — Database schema managed via Alembic. Upgrades run automatically on startup.

### Changes from Upstream

#### Architecture

- **Flask Blueprints** — Split the monolithic `web_server.py` into modular blueprints (`dashboard`, `books`, `settings`, `api`, `logs`, `covers`). Each route group is self-contained.
- **CSS design system** — Extracted inline styles into modular stylesheets with CSS custom properties (`variables.css`, `base.css`, `layout.css`, `components.css`, `dashboard.css`, `settings.css`, `logs.css`, `match.css`).
- **Dependency injection** — All services wired through a DI container for loose coupling and testability.

#### Added

- **Universal book import** — Audio-only and ebook-only import modes alongside the original linked mode.
- **Settings overhaul** — Full UI-driven configuration with multi-library ABS picker, dynamic settings that take effect without restart.

#### Removed

- **Forge pipeline** — Removed the Auto-Forge audiobook processing pipeline. Storyteller linking is now direct via the REST API.
- **Upstream CI/CD** — Removed all upstream GitHub Actions workflows, deploy scripts, and debug tooling.
- **Emoji logging** — Removed emoji prefixes from all log statements in favor of plain text.
- **Dead code** — Cleaned up unused imports, dev markers, and unreachable code paths.
