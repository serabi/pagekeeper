# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

All notable changes to PageKeeper will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **Hardcover bidirectional sync** — Reading status and progress now syncs both directions with Hardcover. Previously write-only.
- **Hardcover journal push** — Journal notes from PageKeeper's reading tracker are pushed to Hardcover as user journal entries.
- **Hardcover reading dates** — Historical `started_at`/`finished_at` dates are tracked and synced with Hardcover.
- **Hardcover sync log** — New "Hardcover Sync" tab on the Logs page shows all sync operations with status, direction, and timestamps.
- **Storyteller submission service** — Submit books directly to Storyteller for narrated EPUB3 creation from the match page. PageKeeper copies the EPUB and audio files to Storyteller's import directory, detects when Storyteller picks them up, and triggers processing via the API.
- **Force Storyteller mode** — Setting that auto-submits all books to Storyteller, skipping local Whisper transcription entirely.
- **Storyteller status badges** — Book cards show submission status: "Awaiting Storyteller" during processing, "Aligned via Storyteller" when complete.
- **Configurable Storyteller timeout** — Import detection timeout is now an advanced setting (default 120s).

### Fixed

- **Race condition in Storyteller submissions** — Reservation record is now created synchronously before any async work, preventing the job scheduler from starting Whisper before the submission exists.
- **Wrong-book matching in Storyteller** — Book detection now requires exact title match and snapshots existing books before import to avoid fuzzy mismatches.
- **Stale Storyteller deferrals** — Job scheduler now polls Storyteller for completion before deferring, so books don't get stuck waiting forever after Storyteller finishes.
- **Booklore None filename crash** — Guard added for audio-only books passed to `find_in_booklore()`.
- **Dockerfile healthcheck** — Fixed endpoint from `/` to `/healthcheck`.
- **`.dockerignore` not read** — File was named `dockerignore` (missing dot). Renamed and updated.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **BookFusion integration** — Upload books from Booklore to BookFusion, sync highlights via the Obsidian plugin API, and save highlights to reading journals. Dual API key support with test-before-save.
- **Reading tracker** — Reading detail page with journal entries, manual progress input, ratings, read counts, and yearly reading goals.
- **Suggestions system** — Dedicated `/suggestions` page with card grid, cover images, match candidates, filter/search, and Dismiss/Link/Never Ask actions. Socket-driven discovery queues suggestions automatically when unmapped audiobooks are detected. Reverse suggestions surface audiobook matches for ebook-only books.
- **Batch matching** — Queue-based batch matching workflow with validation and prefilled linking.
- **Storyteller native alignment** — Allows you to build alignment maps directly from Storyteller's word-level timing data, bypassing Whisper transcription
- **Cover management** — Cover picker modal, custom cover URL support, Hardcover cover search.
- **Processing dashboard UX** — Dedicated processing section with progress bars, retry counts, status accents, and live polling.
- **Reading date sync** — Pull `started_at`/`finished_at` from Hardcover and ABS. Auto-complete books at 100% progress, with re-read guards in place. 
- **Diagnostic test buttons** — One-click connectivity/auth verification for all services in Settings.
- **Dashboard status filter** — Filter book grid by status or sync mode.
- **Hot-reload settings** — Settings changes apply in-process without container restart.

### Changed

- **Backend decomposition** — Extracted SuggestionService, BackgroundJobService, ProgressResetService, and database repositories from monolithic files.
- **Renamed to PageKeeper** — Project renamed from Book Sync across all branding, Docker config, and documentation.
- **Completed book actions** — Streamlined kebab menu: "Sync status to all services" and "Clear Progress" only.

### Fixed

- **Security: exception logging sanitized** — Error handlers no longer log raw exception text or tracebacks at ERROR level, preventing KOSYNC_KEY leakage.
- **Security: path traversal in EPUB resolver** — Filename validation and containment checks on filesystem glob results.
- **Security: API token moved to header** — Cover proxy uses `Authorization: Bearer` instead of query parameter.
- **Security: secrets removed from settings HTML** — Password fields show placeholder instead of emitting stored values.
- **Security: path traversal at HTTP boundaries (CWE-22)** — Sanitize `ebook_filename` inputs and validate resolved paths before file operations.
- **Security: pin h11>=0.16.0** — Fix HTTP Request Smuggling (CVE-2025-43859). Upgrade Docker base to python:3.13-slim.
- **Sync: fallback state save key mismatch** — Leader snapshot now uses correct `'ts'` key and fresh `last_updated`, matching the normal sync path.
- **Sync: Booklore link/unlink stale fields** — Clearing or changing ebook association now updates `kosync_doc_id` and `original_ebook_filename`.
- **Sync: deferred clear progress** — Lock timeout no longer discards pending clear, allowing deferred external reset on next cycle.
- **Sync: clear progress re-sync bounce** — 0% states saved after clearing to prevent stale external progress from bouncing back.
- **UX: custom cover override** — User-set custom covers now correctly override auto-discovered ABS covers.
- **UX: batch queue Ready status** — Storyteller-only items without ebook no longer marked Ready (they can't be processed).
- **Booklore UNIQUE constraint** — Composite `(filename, source)` constraint replaces stale single-column constraint.
- **Suggestion sort tie-breaker** — Booklore matches now correctly prioritized instead of deprioritized.
- **KOSync stale shadow documents** — Sibling resolution skips documents not updated in 30 days.
- **Alignment map validation** — Malformed entries skipped with warning instead of crashing.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-01

### Initial Release

PageKeeper is a self-hosted sync engine that links audiobook listening positions to matching spots in ebooks. It transcribes a segment of the audiobook audio, fuzzy-matches it against the EPUB text, and builds an alignment map. Once built, converting between a timestamp and a page position is instant.

Forked from [abs-kosync-bridge](https://github.com/JadeTech-Solutions/abs-kosync-bridge) and rebuilt with a new architecture.

#### Supported Platforms

| Platform | Type | Function |
|----------|------|----------|
| [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/) | Audiobook server | Main audiobook source; reads/writes progress |
| [KOReader](https://koreader.rocks/) (via KoSync) | E-reader protocol | Ebook reader on Kobo, Boox, Kindle; syncs EPUB position |
| [Storyteller](https://smoores.gitlab.io/storyteller/) | Audiobook companion | Synced audiobook + EPUB app |
| [Booklore](https://github.com/booklore) | Ebook library | Ebook manager; provides EPUB files and tracks reading progress |
| [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/) | Book tracking | Bidirectional reading status, progress, and journal sync |
| [Calibre-Web Automated (CWA)](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated) | OPDS ebook source | Alternative source for fetching EPUBs |

All integrations are optional.

#### Core Features

- **Multi-platform sync** — Keeps audiobook and ebook positions in sync across all configured platforms.
- **Three-tier sync engine** — Instant sync (ABS Socket.IO + KoSync PUT), per-client polling (Storyteller, Booklore), and scheduled full sweep.
- **Audio-to-text alignment** — Whisper (local CPU/GPU), Deepgram (cloud), or Whisper.cpp. Alignment map cached in DB for instant subsequent syncs.
- **Universal book import** — Audio-only, ebook-only, or linked (audio + ebook).
- **Web dashboard** — Book grid with covers, per-service progress, search/filter, and quick actions.
- **Settings UI** — All configuration via web interface. Multi-library ABS picker, per-service toggles, sync tuning.
- **Split-port security** — KoSync API on a separate port from the admin dashboard.
- **Write suppression** — Centralized write tracker prevents feedback loops across clients.

#### Architecture (vs. upstream)

- Flask Blueprints, CSS design system with custom properties, dependency injection container.
- Removed: Forge pipeline, upstream CI/CD, emoji logging, dead code.
