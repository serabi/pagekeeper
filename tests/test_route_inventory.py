"""Behavior-freeze: Flask route inventory snapshot.

This test captures the full set of Flask URL rules (rule pattern, HTTP
methods, and endpoint name) and compares it against a checked-in snapshot at
``tests/snapshots/route_inventory.json``.

Purpose: during the backend cleanup, refactors must not silently add, remove,
rename, or change the method set of any route. The frontend (Jinja shells +
vanilla JS) and external KOReader devices depend on the exact URL surface; a
disappearing route or a changed method set is a contract break.

To intentionally update the snapshot after a *reviewed* route change, run::

    PAGEKEEPER_UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 python -m pytest tests/test_route_inventory.py

See ``tests/snapshots/README.md`` for the full workflow.
